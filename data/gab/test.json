Professor\u00a0Gwythian Prins from the London School of Economics has made a number of comparisons between the failing bloc and the final days of the now defunct Soviet Union to come to this conclusion, and it backs up the opinions of countless others who feel that the EU is ultimately on a hiding to nothing.  According to a\u00a0report in The Express:  Gwythian Prins has warned the elite trade bloc will crumble within a generation because it has become too big, sighting Brexit as proof of its decline.  The Professor has described how anti-EU sentiment is rising across the continent as voters become increasingly frustrated with the actions of the supranational body.

{"text": "Hiking in Varberg, Sweden  On the morning of 24 March, comrades from #Nest2 met in Halland County, #Sweden, for a hiking trip. The weather was a blend of spring and winter, with cool winds from the Kattegat greeting us as we gathered at our starting point.  After going over the itinerary for the day, it was time to set off towards the southeast. For the first four miles we walked through open farmland. When we passed a large farm, a friendly (and possibly anti-Semitic) dog joined our group, but with a little help he soon found his way homeward again.  We had a wide range of discussions on the way, covering everything from our individual hopes and dreams to National Socialist worldviews, anecdotes from our work lives and the importance of our struggle. Such was the good humour among our comrades that the conversations didn\u2019t abate even as the terrain became decidedly steeper. We marched uphill and downhill, through the snow and into the forest. Here the winds finally died away, but the wintry conditions still prevailed. The trees were a mix of spruce and beech, the latter being a distinguishing feature of inland #Varberg.  We stopped regularly to change socks, which proved to be a good way to minimise chafed feet and potential blisters. After passing the villages of Dags\u00e5s and \u00c4stad, we turned northwards and reached \u00c5kulla ahead of schedule. There were took a break to have something to eat and fill our water flasks.  Next we turned south again and made our way past the #Bocksten peat bog and Bexell\u2019s Talking Stones. Bocksten bog is a famous site where the well-preserved remains of Bocksten Man were found in 1936. Boksten Man was believed to be a bailiff in the 1300s who was killed, thrown in the bog and impaled to stop his body rising to the surface. Today his remains are on public display in Varberg Fortress.  Bexell\u2019s Talking Stones are a series of hundreds of rocks that were inscribed with sayings by the former landowner Alfred Bexell at the end of the 19th century. The rocks are spread around a large area of the forest and are not individually marked on maps. Among the inscriptions are words of wisdom such as \u201cA monkey wearing golden jewellery is still a monkey\u201d and \u201cOnce time is lost, it\u2019s gone forever, no matter how much you complain or cry.\u201d  Just after passing the stones we found a suitable place to make camp. We pitched the tent, and lit a fire and stove for grilling. Soon the tent was warm and dry, and the embers were perfect for cooking. After supper we went over fire watch regulations and chatted a little more before it was time to turn in.  On Sunday morning we awoke dry and well rested before making breakfast and packing away the tent. After having covered roughly twelve miles the previous day, we had just over six miles left before we regained our original starting point.  The weather was foggy on the way back, so we decided to diverge from the route to take a detour around a lake. The conversations between comrades continued, and a number of plans were made for the future. Once we arrived back at the starting point, we conducted a brief review of the trip and agreed it was well planned and well executed.  Original article:", "label": 0, "t": 1}
