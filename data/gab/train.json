While this article (initially posted on LinkedIn, June 12th, 2017) is mainly for American readership in the LinkedIn community, and those who may want to pass this article along to others. The ideology of nations (nationalism of any country) across the globe affects politics everywhere, which in turn affects business or commerce, and vice versa. In other words, while the article may seem about American politics, it is also about business, commerce, and economy, because commerce and politics so closely affect one another. Political decisions are continually made that affect commerce. When governments are stable, commerce can thrive and when commerce thrives governments can gain much greater stability. This will continue to happen as long as law and order are used to govern fairness and equality between commercial partners in each nation and around the globe.  Meet the press  While United States Congress, and the main stream media all seem to have plenty of time to waste mulling over President Trump\u2019s intolerance of sub-par performance, and subsequent termination of staff (James Comey), the rest of \u201cwe the people\u201d are still busy trying to get ahead one day at a time. So, for a condensed version of current events, I\u2019ve put together some insights like a quick snapshot of what is going on in America, as a side from the main stream media channels. I know I speak for a lot of Americans to say that we are tired of the press continually hounding our new President over anything they can blow out of proportion attempting to discredit President Trump. The press is continually discrediting their own organizations, and the CEOs and leaders of those organizations by wasting the time and tax dollars forcing President Trump into pointless press meetings over the way he runs things.", "label": 0, "t": 0}

{"text": "The White Man everywhere sets up a PRODUCTIVE economy, in which  everybody works, manages or takes genuine risks in an enterprise in which he  has a personal interest.  The economy of the Aryan is always PRODUCTIVE ENTERPRISE,  regardless of the fancy names that may be applied to various forms of the  operation. Each man gives to the society at least as much as he takes out.  The economy of the Jew is PARASTIC. He always takes out more than he puts  in. As soon as the Jew got enough strength in our society, he began to twist and  pervert this productive enterprise into a criminal operation forbidden by law  almost everywhere for centuries, - USURY.  He began to blind our kind of people to the immorality of GETTING without  producing or giving in return. He began to de-emphasize the PRODUCTION  aspect of the work and management of Aryan economy, and emphasize the  getting of MONEY, by any and all possible means short of robbery. He  removed the focus of Aryan eyes from the PRODUCT to the PROFIT.  Craftsmanship and pride of product began to disappear as the desperate  scramble to GET MONEY replaced the time-honored Aryan joy in creation of  things of excellence and permanence. Turn out more shoddy products, shine  them up to look good on the outside, sell them for as high a price as possible,  and then forget it once the money is in the pocket. That was the new approach  of the Jew, which has filled America with billions of tons of plastic, shoddy  JUNK.  The next step was to de-emphasize ALL production, and concentrate on  MANIPULATION of money and credit to gather in still more money, - without  work, without management, invention or creation, and without any real risk.  Usually the Jew had tribesmen in the councils of the mighty, whence he got the  information that enabled him to \"speculate\" and reap vast harvests of green  cash, - with NO RISK.  This harvest of cash without returning to society value for money received is  immoral and destructive and no society can survive it forever.  The Jew, Karl Marx, then slyly ATTACKED this immoral process, identified it  as the SAME THING as Aryan free enterprise, cleverly called BOTH the  enterprise and the usury, \"CAPITALISM,\" and thus got all our people  DEFENDING JEWISH USURY as our \"sacred way of life,\" - - - \"Capitalism.\"", "label": 0, "t": 1}

The 7th Day Adventist is the only one that comes the closest to following them all.\u00a0 It was a disappointment. Since my father was an Apostolic pastor, I asked him for advice. He said \"Only the 7th Day Adventist comes the closest and that is why I am there now\"\u00a0 However, I have not felt comfortable in any church because most people go there and judge you instead of sharing the love of Christ.  BTW  You should watch a video I posted on Daniel's prophecy.

{"text": "Geert Wilders for Breitbart: Muhammad is Coming to the Dutch Parliament\u00a0  Later this year, the Dutch Parliament will be the scene of a unique and historic event. In the secured offices of my party, the Party for Freedom (PVV) in the building of the Lower House in The Hague, we will be hosting an International Muhammad Cartoon Contest. The exact date of the contest still has to be decided, but the American cartoonist Bosch Fawstin, winner of a similar contest in Garland, Texas, in May 2015, has accepted our invitation to come over to the Netherlands to act as a judge. The contest is open to all nationalities. Everyone who wishes to make a Muhammad cartoon can send his work to our dedicated\u00a0cartoon mailbox.  The contest is not intended to provoke or insult anyone. We organize it because freedom of speech is the most important freedom we have. Today, this freedom is under attack from two sides. Both Islam and our own Western political elites are trying to restrict that freedom. They both try to gag us.  Islam forbids every form of Islam criticism. It also forbids depicting its founder, Muhammad. In the West, however, we should not accept ideological restrictions to free speech. Freedom of speech is the most important freedom we have. It is our duty to use it wherever and whenever we can.  The fact that Islam feels \u201cinsulted\u201d by criticism should not lead to censorship.  \u00a0Moreover, the real problem is not that Islam feels so easily insulted, the real problem is that Islam feels entitled to murder those whom it feels insulted or criticized by. That is why, in 2004, Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was assassinated. That is why there have been attacks on cartoonists. That is also why people like, myself, have been forced to live in hiding for years after Islamic death threats. That is also why British Islam critic Tommy Robinson is seriously in danger.  However, despite the atrocities, we should not be silenced by fear. American founding father Benjamin Franklin said that \u201cThose who give up freedom in order to gain security, deserve neither and will lose both.\u201d It is important that the more our freedom of speech is threatened, the harder we practice it. We must show Islam that the freedom-loving people in the West will never bow to threats and will never curtail their freedom of speech.  \u00a0Our second problem is that Western political elites want to appease Islam by gagging its critics. That is the true reason why the British authorities were so quick to imprison Tommy Robinson after he had reported about a trial of mostly Islamic child rapists. That is also the reason why I have already been dragged to court twice in my home country. That is why so-called \u201chate speech\u201d laws \u2013 laws which are being used against Islam critics \u2013 are being introduced all over the West, with the exception of the United States with its constitutionally guaranteed First Amendment.  Islam wants to gag us, our leaders want to accommodate it. Hence, it is time for us to make a stand. By speaking out or drawing cartoons, we express our freedom of speech. What we once considered a natural element of our existence, our birthright, is now something we once again have to battle for. We do so in an absolutely non-violent way. We do so, not with the sword, but with the pen, including the cartoonist\u2019s drawing pen.  Full Story:", "label": 1, "t": 1}

{"text": "I agree with what you both say, and I struggle with this regularly. Out in the 'Merican West, Boomers are responsible for largely gentrifying younger generations out of land ownership and access. Most can't even afford to rent a family dwelling, even with great paying jobs. Boomers chased the illusory dream and refused to live in simple homes with basic needs, so they tore down all the smaller structures and built extravagant multi-million dollar properties everywhere. Many built them with their own contractor skills and through relationships, so at a fraction of the cost, and thus feel proud of their achievements.  But the reality is, they drove up land prices in rural communities everywhere. And others are still flooding out of cities in large numbers with all of their wealth accumulated across a lifetime increasing the cost of living in all rural White pockets. Our own People are gentrifying out our own ability to economically stay in rooted communities and build resiliency. This is why younger generations all across the West can't afford to live and have families, etc. And our women are too responsible to pop out kids they can't afford en masse, so we all pay taxes for our replacements to pop 'em out and let the streets raise them up, only to hate us. All we have left are an endless array of low end service jobs and million dollar properties, or to choose to go live in large urban hell holes. Buying a home is out of reach for 90+% of us, with no end in sight. So yeah, there's a lot for us younger folks to be pissed about with Boomers.  When you consider that its something like over 90% of all wealth in this country (assets, lands, resources) is in the hands of those over 60, you start to understand how gentrified and stratified and unsustainable this arrangement is. I think that is why younger Americans XYZ hate Boomers with a passion. They've never showed they have cared about younger generations, and they talk to us about pulling up our bootstraps and creating how they did. Times just aren't the same, and they refuse to come to terms with that.  And, I also get that some have lived humble lives. My mother grew up with outhouses in Montana and has never lived in a large nor even semi-fancy house, but that level of humility is rare in the boomer crowds.", "label": 0, "t": 1}

{"text": "\u201cThe Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, from the Freemasons to Facebook\u201d\u00a0by Niall Ferguson\u00a0  Reflexivity is, in effect, a two-way feedback mechanism in which reality helps shape the participants\u2019 thinking and the participants\u2019 thinking helps shape reality.\u2019\u2019 - George Soros.  Which is most important, powerful - networks or hierarchy?  How can one man, George Soros, \u2018break the Bank of England\u2019 and the entire British government helpless to stop him?  Ferguson\u2019s book is a masterful analysis (synthesis) of this very question. The answer derives from understanding the difference between - the distributed strength of networks (Soros) vs the concentrated power of organizations (government).  Great!  \u201cIt tells the story of the interaction between networks and hierarchies from ancient times until the very recent past. It brings together theoretical insights from myriad disciplines, ranging from economics to sociology, from neuroscience to organizational behaviour.\u2019\u2019  As he says, Ferguson covers a lot of stuff. Easy to follow, but reader (listener) needs serious commitment. Detailed and historical. Comprehensive and profound.  \u201cIts central thesis is that social networks have always been much more important in history than most historians, fixated as they have been on hierarchical organizations such as states, have allowed \u2013but never more so than in two periods. The first \u2018networked era\u2019 followed the introduction of the printing press to Europe in the late fifteenth century and lasted until the end of the eighteenth century. The second \u2013our own time \u2013dates from the 1970s, though I argue that the technological revolution we associate with Silicon Valley was more a consequence than a cause of a crisis of hierarchical institutions.\u2019\u2019  Ferguson willing to think against the grain. Confident but not arrogant, offers reasons along with conclusions.  \u201cThe intervening period, from the late 1790s until the late 1960s, saw the opposite trend: hierarchical institutions re-established their control and successfully shut down or co-opted networks. The zenith of hierarchically organized power was in fact the mid-twentieth century \u2013the era of totalitarian regimes and total war.\u2019\u2019 (xxv)  Make no mistake, this is no dry, technical, theoretical history lesson.

The INSEE data from Seine-Saint-Denis looked at the top baby names from 2017 and extrapolated that the trend will likely continue into 2019 with Mohamed being the most popular male name in the district, broadcaster BFMTV\u00a0reports.  Several other non-traditional\u00a0French names also made it into the top ten male baby names for the suburbs including Ibrahim at number three, Rayan at number four, Amir at seven, Imran at eight, and Ali at nine. Gabriel, the most popular name\u00a0in the city of Paris, did not even make it into the top ten for the suburbs.  Of the top 20 names, 12 are of apparent Middle Eastern origin while the\u00a0list of girls baby names\u00a0in Seine-Saint-Denis also has a significant number of names that originate from the region, as well.  The new statistics come after Muhammed, and various alternative spellings of the name were shown to be the\u00a0most common name\u00a0in both England and Wales for newborn boys earlier this month.  Muhammad Names are Top For Baby Boys in England and Wales Muhammad was the most popular name for baby boys in English regions London, the West Midlands, and Yorkshire and the Humber in 2017, government statistics show, with spelling variations in the name...  In Germany, a report from the\u00a0Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache (Society for German Language, GfdS) in January of this year noted the dramatic rise in the number of babies named Mohammed in Germany over the last several years saying that the name had gone\u00a0from 97th place to 26th place\u00a0in less than a decade.  As in the UK, the GfdS does not count all the variations of the spelling of Mohammed as one name and so the actual number has the potential to be much higher.  The popularity of the names reflects the growing migrant-background population across Europe and mass migration is now seen as the\u00a0primary source\u00a0of\u00a0population growth across nearly the entirety of Western Europe.", "label": 0, "t": 0}

Hang man's rope plays out... just a little longer, further. For these last many months I'll bet Ford has been getting coached and trained by the best (of the worst) in America. Of course her performance at the hearing was stellar. The Senate got played by a one act sob story put on by CIA, but then I have to wonder how many of them let out a few more yards of rope too.

I did a lot of other stuff at that age that was a lot worse but not related to getting inebriated.\u00a0  I was smoking weed and taking amphetamine tabs ( trucker whites) at 7. My brother and friends were shooting heroin then and age about 11.  I drank lots of beer and smoked weed , dropped acid etc from 14 to 16.  watched all my friends and family shooting heroin and pills. My brother shot 60 percodans just to keep from getting sick.  We huffed toluene all day and night. Drank a lot. Hash weed acid .. you name it we did it.  I saw the damage. Just like Neil , the needle and the damage done, I saw the damage.  Spent 25 years snorting cocaine, when it was pure not the trash they have now. Drank so much the liquor store had a dolly waiting for me every day to load up 24 packs of old english 800 , mad dog and captain morgan spiced rum on almost every fucking day. Only possible from all the cocaine that fueled my ass.  Stayed up no less than 2 weeks at a time and sometimes well over a month. Try dealing with life on that sleep time line.  Brother , cousin, friends all dead.  Tattoo on my left arm done by my dead friend. It is only half done but stays that way. You can see it my pics I post if you look.  I know narcotics very well.  Lynn murdered by Wolford and George with skrew driver for scrip.  Bonnie , 2 doors away, murdered with knife by grandson for $3.00 for a lortab .  Charlene across street murdered by boyfriend with hammer for scrip.  Ive tossed my friends that OD'd out into field and by the lake.  Ive watched my friends die from shooting too much coke while having diabetes.  Ive watched the gang bangers kill my friend on my couch over some little bit of money.  My friends killed by gang bangers over money several times  Ive shot ,stabbed, beat with tire irons and axe handles people that owed me. I shoved shotgun in girls mouth to get info about where her brother was over a lousy 125 bucks. WTF ? this is insane.\u00a0  I beat the shit out of peoples kids because they owed me. WTF ? Insane.  I have shoved my 9 in the mouth of a baby to make the parents go get my money. I would have killed their baby if my cash dod not show up fast. WTF ? INSANE !  FUCK YOU !  So what the hell ever you heard on TV about the big opiate epidemic is not shit. You heard and think you know but I lived the shit all my fucking life !  Your media given idea of dope is a fantasy Island utopia compared to real life. Never think all that BS on the news is the real deal. Life in the dope scene is more than you can handle.  So don't try to school my sorry ass. I lived more than you will ever read or hear on the news.  I should ask no forgiveness for anything I have done but I do I beg forgiveness from those I have wronged but do not expect them to give it to me as I do not deserve it.  God will forgive me but they will only do it if they believe in the Word.  When I say junkies are a lost cause I mean it with a blast like dynamite . Very few can be saved. I know.  My heavenly Father please forgive me for the horrible things I have done. Send me to hell if you cant. I deserve it.", "label": 0, "t": 1}

The secret memo also said more than \u201c40 House offices may have been victims of IT security violations.\u201d  In the memo,\u00a0Congress\u2019s top law enforcement official, Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, along with Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko, wrote,\u00a0\u201cWe have concluded that the employees [Democratic systems administrator Imran Awan and his family] are an ongoing and serious risk to the House of Representatives, possibly threatening the integrity of our information systems and thereby members\u2019 capacity to serve constituents.\u201d  The memo, addressed to the Committee on House Administration (CHA) and dated Feb. 3, 2017, was recently reviewed and transcribed by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The letter bolsters TheDCNF\u2019s previous reporting about the\u00a0missing\u00a0server\u00a0and\u00a0evidence\u00a0of\u00a0fraud\u00a0on Capitol Hill.  It details how the caucus server, run by then-caucus Chairman Rep. Xavier Becerra, was secretly copied by authorities after the House Inspector General (IG) identified suspicious activity on it, but the Awans\u2019 physical access was not blocked.  But after, the report reads, the server appears to have been secretly replaced with one that looked similar.  The memo called for firing the Pakistani-born aides, revoking all their computer accounts, and changing the locks on any door they had access to.  Rep. Louie Gohmert \u2014 a Texas Republican on the House Committee on the Judiciary who has done oversight work on the case \u2014\u00a0said\u00a0the missing server contained copies of Congress members\u2019 emails.  \u201cThey put 40 members of Congress\u2019s data on one server \u2026 That server, with that serial number, has disappeared,\u201d he said.  Multiple sources connected to the investigation told TheDCNF that shortly after an IG report came out identifying the House Democratic Caucus server as key evidence in a criminal probe, the evidence was stolen.  \u201cThey [the Awans] deliberately turned over a\u00a0fake server\u201d to falsify evidence, one official close to the CHA alleged. \u201cIt was a breach. The data was complete out of possession.\u201d  \u2022 In September of 2016 \u2026 the CHA and  briefed the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus about suspicious activity related to their server that the  identified. As a result, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus directed the CAO to copy the data from their server and two computers.

On March 4, 2002, on Takur Ghar mountain in Afghanistan, Sergeant Chapman\u2019s aircraft came under heavy enemy fire and was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. One teammate was ejected from the aircraft, and the crippled helicopter crash landed in the valley below.

Sergeant Chapman charged\u00a0into enemy fire through harrowing conditions, seized an enemy bunker, and killed its enemy occupants. Despite severe wounds, he continued to fight relentlessly, sustaining a violent engagement with multiple enemy personnel before paying the ultimate sacrifice. Sergeant Chapman\u2019s heroic actions, at the cost of his life, are credited with saving the lives of his teammates.  \u201cOur nation is rich with blessings,\u201d\u00a0President Trump said yesterday. \u201cBut our greatest blessings of all are the patriots like John.\u201d", "label": 0, "t": 0}

{"text": "Hebrews 11:17-19  The event referred to in this passage is found in Genesis chapter 22. This is one of the more poignant passages of the Bible and used to be a favourite passage in Bible reading competitions in my childhood.  God had long promised Abraham a son and an heir. As Sarah his wife aged, Abraham was eventually persuaded by his wife to have a child with his servant-girl Hagar. The result was Ishmael, the father of the Arabs. But although God blessed Ishmael and made him a great nation, he was not the fulfilment of God's promise to Abraham.  Some thirteen years after Ishmael's birth God promised that Sarah herself would have a son and that his name should be called Isaac and that Abraham's lineage would be reckoned through him. A year later, Isaac was born, in Abraham's and Sarah's old age.  Some years after that, God tested Abraham's faith. He told him to take the miracle child of his old age, the one through whom God had promised to perpetuate his line, and sacrifice him on one of the mountains of Moriah. Abraham journeyed three days with his son and a couple of servants until they came near the place. He then put the firewood for the sacrifice on the back of his son to carry, and he himself carried the fire and the knife.  His son asked him where the lamb for the sacrifice was. Abraham answered evasively. When Abraham had built an altar and laid the wood in order, he tied up his son and put him on the altar. He then took the knife to sacrifice his son.  Then God intervened. It had all been a test to see how far Abraham would go in obedience to God. Abraham looked behind him, and there was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. Abraham offered the ram instead of his son.  The writer to the Hebrews makes the point that the father offered up his only begotten son. He did so in faith, believing God's previous promises, and surmising that God would still fulfil them through raising Isaac from the dead. It is hard to find a greater example of faith in the Bible. In a sense, one could say that Abraham received his son back from the dead.  This is a clear picture of God who gave his beloved and only begotten Son for the world - John 3:16. Just as Isaac carried the firewood on his back on which he would be sacrificed, so Jesus carried his cross to Calvary. In Jesus' case however there was no ram to take his place. God's purposes were not thwarted by the death of his Son, but they were part of his plan, and Christ rose from the dead in a more literal way than Isaac had done.  Genesis chapter 22 takes place on one of the mountains of Moriah. Many years later the temple would be built on Mount Moriah - 2.Chronicles 3:1. It was in a later temple, on this site, that the veil between the sanctuary and the holy of holies would be torn in two from the top to the bottom at the moment of Jesus' death - Matthew 27:50,51, when his sacrifice to God was offered for the sins of the world.", "label": 0, "t": 0}

Iranian Cities Hit By Protests For Fourth Day Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, August 4, 2018:  Hundreds of protesters returned to the streets of several Iranian cities on August 3, according to social media posts, for a fourth consecutive day of demonstrations amid growing anxiety over the country\u2019s economic difficulties and the return of U.S. sanctions.  Iranian media reported that demonstrators attacked a Shi\u2019ite seminary west of the capital, Tehran, on August 3 as protests against economic woes turned into antigovernment rallies.  Iranians are angered by high inflation and increasing economic hardship caused in part by the dramatic decline of the national currency, the rial.  In the town of Eshtehard, 100 kilometers west of Tehran, riot police dispersed several hundred people who chanted slogans against the government late on August 3, with some throwing rocks and bricks at a Shi\u2019ite Muslim seminary, the semiofficial Fars news agency said on August 4.  In Washington, the U.S. State Department said on its Persian-language Twitter account on August 3: \u201cWhile it is ultimately up to the people of Iran to determine their country\u2019s path, America supports the voice of the Iranian people, which has been ignored for a long time.\u201d  \u2018Death To Khamenei\u2019", "label": 0, "t": 1}

The decision also called for the sides to \u201cavoid appropriation of churches, monasteries and other properties, as well as every other act of violence and retaliation \u2026\u201d  The Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyiv Patriarchate, which has led the process of creating a single canonical Ukrainian Orthodox church, expects the ecumenical patriarchate will grant official canonical recognition with a church tomos (decree) at a synod in late November, church spokesman Yevstratiy Zoria said after Constantinople\u2019s announcement. Patriarch Filaret called for a convention to be attended by the representatives of Ukraine\u2019s Orthodox Christian churches to unite under a single canonical church structure. The Moscow Patriarchate can remain in Ukraine but must be renamed the Russian Orthodox Church, he said.  Among Ukraine's Orthodox Christians, about 45.2% said they are affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyiv Patriarchate, compared to 16.9% who said they are affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate, according to a poll conducted of 10,000 respondents between Aug. 30 and Sept. 9 by three leading Kyiv polling firms. The Moscow Patriarchate has enjoyed canonical status since 1989.  The ecumenical patriarchate reached \u201ca catastrophic decision for global Orthodox Christianity,\u201d said Aleksandr Volkov, the press secretary of Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill. The legalization of the activity of schismatics will force the Russian Orthodox Church to cease its eucharistic communication with the Constantinople church, he said. A Moscow Patriarchate spokesman in Kyiv called for placing an anathema on Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew for his decision to remove the anathema against Patriarch Filaret, which it alleged was beyond its authority.  Meanwhile, the efforts of Ukrainian Orthodox church leaders to unite under a single church were endorsed by Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine. Besides stressing the importance of freedom of religion, Volker called on all sides to avoid violence. This morning, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov issued a statement warning of a firm response against provocations and violence based on religious \u201cstrife and intolerance.\u201d He called on the public to avoid provocations and speculations.", "label": 0, "t": 1}

Accordingly, targets should if possible be chosen to avoid such injury. Thus, buildings are chosen when they are empty of workers and so on. There is in these instances \u2013 and particularly with isolated targets such as relay masts, pylons etc. \u2013 no need to hide the explosive device, or fit them with anti-tamper mechanisms. They simply have to placed to cause the maximum damage, and either detonated \u201con site\u201d or fitted with a simple delay mechanism. On the practical level, explosives need to be obtained, and intelligence gathered on suitable targets. The initial targets chosen could be those fairly isolated ones where a simple device, without a wireless remote control or electronic timer-detonator, can do damage. Suitable initial targets are electricity pylons; TV relay masts; oil pipelines (generally buried over six feet below ground, so some digging necessary) and so on. Summary: On the practical level, the best strategy for the immediate future is the following. (1) Assassination of several soft targets; (2) Start of campaign of sabotage by using explosive devices against vulnerable, low-risk targets. Once these initial things have been done \u2013 and more weapons and training acquired - then a long-term campaign of sabotage, assassination and insurrection can be started with the aim of creating the revolutionary situation that is necessary. It must be understood that this campaign has to be maintained for at least five to ten years for success to be achieved. The organization needs feasible and practical aims which it can demand from the government every time an action is successfully undertaken \u2013 with these aims being understood as some of the things the organization is fighting for. These aims have to specific, as they could in theory be conceded by the government. One such aim is to demand that the government make a public denunciation of the holocaust lie. Another is to demand the right of Aryans to educate their children in Aryan-only schools. Another is to demand that Aryans be allowed to carry weapons in public for their own self-defence. The primary aim for which the organization is fighting \u2013 and which all such similar organizations and NS individuals are fighting for \u2013 is an independent Aryan homeland where we can live among our own kind, in peace, and according to our own natural laws and Aryan customs. In this homeland, our own Aryan culture can flourish as our children can be educated in an Aryan and National Socialist way. This primary aim has to made known every time an action is successfully undertaken.", "label": 0, "t": 0}

{"text": "Let's not forget that the 9/11 and 7/7 suicide bombers were highly educated. They were far from poor as well. Bin Laden was an engineer, educated in the best western universities. Do you think the ISIS leaders are poor or uneducated? Do you think the jihadists who left Sweden to fight in Syria are poor and ignorant? They are usually born in Sweden and have been educated like any other European. Ignorance and poverty are also fallacies when you deal with religion.\u00a0  People always refuse to blame religion for some strange reason. \"Oh, the problem is poverty\" or \"Yeah, the problem is the lack of education\"\u2014or even \"It's just the result of western foreign policy\" (which is the worst kind of bullcrap). These are scapegoats. Apart from being plainly wrong statements, they help the jihadists and other cretins. \"Haha, let the liberals try to find a reason for our death cult. In the meanwhile, we keep assassinating them.\"  I'd argue that ISIS' aim is not profit. It obviously helps, but as a fundamentalist religious organisation, its main objectives are religious in nature. I understand the urge to rationalise their fanatical ways\u2014as atheists/agnostics it's very difficult to grasp such justifications\u2014but I think we need to realise that we're dealing with a phenomenon that disappeared in Europe a long time ago, so we're not really used to it anymore. We can't use modern economic theories (from Marx to the Austrian school) to explain blind faith. Profit is the method, yes, it's the necessary tool which oils the jihad machine, but their end game is much, much more perverse. Our rational western minds are not prepared for such a nightmare. That's why I think we should change our strategy. We need to look deeper at the religious aspect, in their dogmas and rituals, trying to find Islam's Achilles heels. The only way out is a reform.\u00a0  ***  One more interesting argument. ISIS is known for killing all residents of Syrian or Iraq villages. 300, 400 people at the time, just because they're classified as infidels/haram/impure. Mass executions are common. This behaviour can't be explained by economics. It's counterintuitive, from an economic point of view, to destroy entire villages and cities. If profit was ISIS' aim, they would control that population or slave them. This 'scorched earth' strategy is a desperate measure. It's only used in massive wars or, as we can see, in completely irrational religious fervour.  #unpopularthoughts", "label": 0, "t": 1}

{"text": "Reflecting back when I was in school with Special Ed. I was with students like me that are high functioning but need extra help at times being A.D.D. or plain hyper active that I was a hyper child.  Later on in Jr High, I was main streamed in classes like Math and English. My mental status was lower then my grade so in 9th grade, I was with the 7th or 8th graders in that class for main streaming. I also worked in the cafeteria washing tables and washing the food trays and dishes. Last year I happen to run into the Cafeteria Manager that retired a few years after I graduated and she said I was the best one working in the Work Study Program. My Teacher gave me a grade like A-, I should have asked my Home Room Teacher how I could get a 100-Perfect Score! :-) I even tried to work when I got hurt, some student was just playing around and kicked me (I don't think he meant to hurt me or be a bully) just playing around and then my knee popped out of place. My knee went back in but my knee hurt and was swelling. I was told to stop working. Any other student probably went home these days but being a tough kid with pain, I just shook it off.  Thinking why my knee popped out of place, I think the knee socket was weak. A year ago that incident I was involved in a bicycle accident. I was racing a friend down the street, my brakes failed because it was wet on May 14th 1978, I think it was on Mothers Day of all days!\u00a0 I had three fractures in my right leg which lead me to the Hospital. I think I was 14-15 Years old when this happened and being a tough kid with pain, on the 3rd day in the Hospital, I had an eye operation. It had nothing to do with the accident, I was born with a Lazy Eye or pupil drifted off to to the right. I had that corrected on the 3rd day in the Hospital and had to wear a patch for like a month. I hated the infection part of excessive mucus drainage that had to be cleaned daily. Anyhow getting back to Special Ed. Education.  By 1981-1983, there was a change of main streaming students, it had its Pro's and Con's, Good Thing Or Bad as how you take it. For me I had to get used to it. In 1981-1982, was a rough year and of an adjustment being in Special Ed. The School Administrators thought it was a good thing to main stream students with stronger disabilities along with the higher functioning students in Special Ed. That meant you had students with Down Syndrome and students that were extreme S.B.H. (Severe Behavioral Handicap) One was an obese bully who continued to harass me and I was his target for some reason. I got upset over his behavior of him lashing out on me. The Bully did pick on others in the class room but I was more of a target. As far as students with Down Syndrome and the Bully, I just wanted out of there and thought; \"What did I get myself into here?\" What kept me focused was a class project, taking care of a Holstein Hereford Heifer Cow, Her name was Betsy. I always Loved Animals and after school was a tough love lesson that Betsy would eventually get butchered and I wept. Later I got used to the Students and became good friends with students that had stronger disabilities. As well as the Bully, he graduated when I was in 11th grade. 12th Grade was my best year! :-) The irony of it all, I had no recognition in 11th grade during an awards ceremony and banquet and had perfect attendance. 12 Grade was a different matter and got rewarded left and right and had Perfect Attendance in 11th-12th Grade. Not Included I had Perfect Attendance in 4th grade.  In closing with Pro's and Cons with main streaming, it could be a Good Thing or Bad, especially with Students that have Stronger Disabilities. One thing is the atmosphere between Good and Bad", "label": 0, "t": 0}

Example,10 years ago lots of people believed the only reason there were almost no electric cars on the market was due to a conspiracy by oil companies. Now that Tesla exists we all see the real costs and challenges that come with electric cars.  Walk into any southern Baptist Church and ask the sweet old lady playing the piano if we should have laws that prevent hate speech, like fuck, cunt, or taking the Lord's name in vain. She'll say \"absolutely sweetie\". Then ask her if America should allow the poor immigrants from Mexico to come in so they can escape the violence in their own country and have a better life for their family. She'll say \"oh of course!\" Then ask her if abortion should be legal. She'll say \"Heck no! What do you think I am a democrat?\"  The probability of this story being true was much higher about 20 years ago. But thanks to the internet we're all getting exposed to better arguments from people like Ben Shapiro on a daily basis.

{"text": "The U.K. statistics were obtained by the Barnabas Fund, an organization that tracks the persecution of Christians around the world.  From Breitbart:  The British government has admitted that no Christians were taken among the Syrian refugees flown into Britain recently, with the Home Office rejected the handful of non-Muslims selected for resettlement by the United Nations.  Despite the persecution of Christians at the hands of Islamic extremists in Syria having been declared genocide by the U.S., the European Union (EU) and even British MPs themselves in a 2016 parliamentary vote, the 1,112 Syrians that Britain resettled in the first three months of 2018 consisted only of Muslims.  The Barnabas Fund, an aid agency which supports Christians persecuted for their faith, obtained the figures via Freedom of Information requests after \u201ca protracted tussle with the Home Office\u201d, The Sunday Times reports.  According to the data, 1,226 (90 percent) of the 1,358 individuals recommended by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for resettlement in the United Kingdom during the first three months of this year were Sunni Muslims, who comprise around 65 per cent of Syrians.  While Christians are estimated to make up just over 10 per cent of the country\u2019s population, only four \u2014 none of whom were approved by the Home Office for resettlement \u2014 were among refugees recommended by the UN, along with one atheist and 127 (9.5 per cent) people from Shi\u2019ite and other non-Sunni strands of Islam.  The campaign group, which last year accused the UNHCR of unfairly prioritising Sunni Muslims over persecuted minorities when recommending refugees for resettlement in the West, stressed it was not requesting special treatment for Christians but for people to be selected \u201con the basis of vulnerability\u201d.  Martin Parsons, head of research at the Barnabas Fund head of research, said the charity believes a \u201ccultural problem\u201d lies behind the scarcity of Christians among refugees recommended for resettlement, pointing to UN criteria which counts disability and sexual orientation as markers of vulnerability, but not the targeting of people for their religious faith.  \u201cIf someone is gay, the penalty under sharia is death, but if someone converts from Islam to Christianity, the penalty is also death,\u201d he told the Sunday Times, adding that last week\u2019s deadly attack in Sweida illustrated that religious minorities are still very much a target for Islamic militants.  More than 250 people were killed and dozens more wounded and injured in what media reports say was a \u201cbrutal but well-planned, 12-hour attack\u201d on the Druze ancestral homeland, which features a prominent Orthodox Christian minority.  Having infiltrating Druze towns in the early hours of the morning, jihadis knocked on doors and murdered entire families, leaving one person per household alive as witness to the brutality, and they used suicide vests and sniper rifles to slaughter civilians, according to the Guardian.  Breitbart London reported in October how the Barnabas Fund accused British and UNHCR officials of \u201cshocking behaviour\u201d after Home Office figures showed that more than 95 per cent of refugees recommended for resettlement were Sunni Muslims.  Having brought Syrian Christian refugees to safety in countries including Australia, Poland, and the Czech Republic, the charity branded Britain\u2019s ignoring of calls to accept more people from vulnerable religious minorities among the 20,000 Syrians it committed to take a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d.", "label": 1, "t": 1}

Don't kid yourself, they're here, and they take notes. Free Speech is great, and, by and large, it is free, but be careful of anyone trying to egg you into making extreme or violent comments. I've avoided (more like reduced) making inflammatory comments after reading the following, or agreeing with them, or upvoting them. Just a heads up:  Department Of Justice Uses Grand Jury Subpoena To Identify Anonymous Commenters on a Silk Road Post at Reason dot com  \u00a0  The United States Department of Justice is using federal grand jury subpoenas to identify anonymous commenters engaged in typical internet bluster and hyperbole in connection with the Silk Road prosecution. DOJ is targeting Reason.com, a leading libertarian website whose clever writing is eclipsed only by the blowhard stupidity of its commenting peanut gallery.  Why is the government using its vast power to identify these obnoxious asshats, and not the other tens of thousands who plague the internet?  Because these twerps mouthed off about a judge.  This, above, coupled with the recent news stories of the FBI catching online a number of right-wing extremists - except what the FBI caught was a number of other agents trying to stir people to make threatening comments, agents provocateur if you will. I'm surprised that the FBI isn't looking for muslim terrorists, and left-wing terrorists, but in an article on the FBI site they claim right-wing terrorism exceeded left-wing terrorism years ago. I'm thinking we need to donate T.V.s to the FBI, I guess they haven't been watching the left, and illegal immigrants, stop traffic and trash cities. Most of the right-wing terrorism the FBI finds is of the FBI's own doing.", "label": 0, "t": 1}

Is all of history recorded? Are the annals of human history the past, the future, predestined or pre-ascribed?

{"text": "Chemnitz Migrant Murder Suspect Had Prior Convictions And Was Set for Deportation\u00a0  One of the two migrant men arrested in the fatal stabbing of a man in the German city of Chemnitz, which led to mass street protests, has been revealed to have had several prior convictions and was set for deportation. The man, 22-year-old Iraqi Yousif A., was identified after the police arrest warrant for him and Syrian migrant\u00a0Alaa S., 23, was\u00a0leaked online\u00a0earlier this week. New revelations about the Iraqi failed asylum seeker show that he has been in trouble with the law and been convicted of crimes but had not been deported,\u00a0Kronen Zeitung\u00a0reports.  Records\u00a0from 2016 and 2017 show the various convictions including a two-year suspended sentence for serious bodily injury, a fine for property damage, a drug possession\u00a0conviction and another for drug dealing, and a conviction for fraud. He was also shown not to be in possession\u00a0of a valid residency permit, fueling speculation as to why he had not been deported.  German newspaper\u00a0Die Welt\u00a0also\u00a0revealed\u00a0that the 22-year-old had first claimed asylum in Bulgaria and was scheduled\u00a0for deportation in 2016 but was not because the agency in charge took longer than six months.  A resident of the asylum shelter where\u00a0Yousif A. lived described him as smoking a lot of cannabis and drinking alcohol and added that he \u201calways had a knife\u201d on him for defence purposes.  Both he and Alaa S. are suspected of stabbing a 35-year-old German named Daniel\u00a0Hillig on Sunday who later died of his wounds in hospital following the brutal attack.  On Sunday evening,\u00a01,000 residents\u00a0of the city formed a spontaneous demonstration after being called upon by a\u00a0local far-right football hooligan firm. Several reports claimed that members of the Sunday protest had targetted anyone who looked like a foreigner with at least three criminal complaints being filed.  A larger protest was held on Monday with estimates of around\u00a07,500 people\u00a0attending.  On Thursday, yet another protest took place when Minister-President of Saxony and member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Michael Kretschmer\u00a0visited\u00a0the city.  \u201cI came to this livable city with great enthusiasm, which\u00a0has left behind\u00a0very disturbing\u00a0events\u00a0in recent days,\u201d he said and added: \u201cDecent people live here in Chemnitz.\u00a0You should not put them under general suspicion\u201d, he said.  The protests have been widely condemned as \u201cfar-right\u201d by the German media and most\u00a0recently by United Nations\u00a0High Commissioner for Human Rights\u00a0Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein.  Mr Hussein\u00a0reacted\u00a0to reports of a small number of people giving Hitler salutes during one of the protests saying: \u201cI think it\u2019s fundamentally important for politicians across Europe to denounce this.\u201d", "label": 1, "t": 0}

Jun 7 Following a new rash of \u201cillnesses\u201d similar to those experienced by diplomatic staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, a number of Americans have been evacuated from the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, China.  State Department Press Secretary Heather Nauert would only state that \u201ca number\u201d of Americans had been affected, but could not confirm an exact number, and would not say how many had been evacuated from the facility. Tests are now being offered to all diplomatic personnel who have concerns, or want a \u201cbaseline\u201d screening.  The situation in Cuba was first reported in 2016 and was ultimately deemed to be a series of \u201cspecific attacks,\u201d although the State Department has not publicly identified a cause or a perpetrator. Those attacks were accompanied by unexplained sonic phenomena, which led to them being described as \u201csonic attacks.\u201d  The Chinese Foreign Ministry claims it has not been approached about the issue in Guangzhou. Spokeswoman Hua Chunying added:  \u201cIf the U.S. makes formal contact with us, China will continue necessary investigations in an earnest and responsible manner and maintain close communication and cooperation with the U.S.\u201d  China claimed to have investigated the first reported incident and officials said they could not determine the cause.  The Associated Press is reporting that Americans evacuated from China are being brought to the University of Pennsylvania, where doctors have been treating and studying patients brought over from Cuba. The research and treatment team there released its preliminary findings several months ago, reporting the patients suffered from sensory and memory problems consistent with concussions.

{"text": "An explanation of \"Net Neutrality\" for the non-techie by Saul Montes-Bradley  (1) It is not a technology thing at all, and no different than bank, or auto or insurance agencies regulation. Likewise, the name itself \"net neutrality\" is a good example of doublespeak, not unlike \"affordable care act.\"   (2) I hope you understand that \"affordable care\" has nothing to do with either health care or affordability, but is is a way to destroy competition and concentrate business into the hands of a few select monopolies.   (3) Likewise, \"net neutrality\" has nothing to do with neutrality at all. The base of the canard is the notion that somehow free marlests produce imbalances that favor the few. And as some companies grow, the may \"exclude\" someone, for whatever reason, from full participation.   (4) Of course, we know that to be a canard, especially in a rapidly evolving environment in which the behemoths of yesterday (Mosaic, Netscape, Yahoo) are the losers of today, and where open competition makes it possible for a couple of nerds to create tomorrows behemoth.   (5) In fact, it is precisely that dinamic of new entries innovation and obsolecence that is at the root of the vitality of our system and in this case, what has transformed our lives through investment in areas of unlimited potential.  (6) So much so, that if, say, a bunch of cocmpanies tried to have an agreement to, say, limit hiring bonuses or cap salaries to increase their benefits, they'd be breaking the law. Cartels are no legal. That fuels competition at all levels.  (7) Whoever offers the best toy or services gets the most customers, and whoever pays better gets the best workers who, in turn, also have the incentive to strike on their own with a better widget. Trillions & trillions have been created in the net business since the late 80s.  (8) As a customer I have benefited enormously as well. I used to pay 2,700 a month for phone services that now cost me less than 200 a year and I can see your face, to boot. I have access to mountains of information and you and I can be having this conversation.  (9) If a company gets too greedy, lazy or partisan, we switch with ease, and the barrier to entry is ridiculously low. Ironically, Bill Gates of all people articulated this wonderfully in the 90s. And he was right then. Enters Mussolini.  (10) The stated aim of the Fascist state is to achieve social justice through social peace through a stricg reglamentation of the means of production that reduces social tension and does away with conflict, that increasing productivity. This is done throgh \"Corporations\"  (11) Hence, we refer to fascism as a \"Corporativist state.\" Alas, there is a little semantics problem well exploited by Fascists to confuse you. In the US, a \"Corporation\" is any enterprise that has been incorporated as a legal entity.  (12) A mom and pop import-export business in Queens and Exxon Mobil. They are all Corporations. So, intellectually dishonest people refer to Capitalism as a Corporate state,\" or a state that favors corporations.  (13) Alas, Corporations in the Fascist sense are not commercial enterprises at all, but Cartels. Unions be it of workers or industries; colleges and trade associations. In the Fascist model, we all must belong to one such Corporation.  (14) - (26) THE REST IS HERE:", "label": 0, "t": 0}

For example, NAFTA allowed big agriculture from America into Mexico, where they promptly depleted the shallow wells that indigenous farmers were using for irrigation, leaving formerly self-sufficient people with only the options of death, slavery, or leaving.\u00a0 \u00a0They chose to leave.\u00a0\u00a0  I don't want them here -- they belong there.\u00a0 \u00a0But it is simplistic to expect people to just whither up and die.\u00a0 Instead, we have to look at the big picture and see how, maybe, the profit motive of big agriculture was willing to destroy our country AND another country just to put money in the bank for the next quarter.  Places like Guatemala and Honduras are largely shitholes due to corrupt governments put in place by the United States to (try to act shocked) protect the interests of our corporations.\u00a0 \u00a0  Reasonable people can find win-win solutions to these problems, where we correct our own government's deliberate contribution to these problems so that deported people are being deported to a better situation than the one they left.\u00a0\u00a0  In Europe its a different matter -- our aid has created a population bomb in Africa that requires a level of technology that the population cannot sustain without continuous outside help.\u00a0 That requires an entirely different level of intervention.

For all intents and purposes, they can become enemies of the people, not servants thereof. Such is the case with John McCain.  I respected John McCain's service and still do. I appreciate the sacrifices he made but that respect was shelved and replaced with pure, 24 karat disdain when he became a U.S.senator. His values were not the people's. His loyalty no longer laid with his country or the constitution. He became not just a political opponent, not just someone that I disagreed with, but a dyed-in-the-wool enemy of the American people. One who was looked at as such by people from many states and a complete embarrassment to the people of Arizona. One who, unfortunately, could only be removed by death.  Judge me as you will, I don't care. Am I glad that he's dead? Yes. The fact that he died makes me neither happy nor sad. The fact that he is out of office now is gratifying.

Defenders of individual freedom can only attempt to convince the lost through intellectual debate. Many will hear, some won't, and that's life.

{"text": "Soros-Backed Group Ramps up Campaign for Second Referendum While EU Court to Rule Whether Brexit Can Be Stopped\u00a0  Factions of the Remain campaign have doubled down their attempts to stop Brexit after the Soros-backed Best for Britain group will target voters in \u2018swing\u2019 constituencies, while another group of anti-Brexit activists are taking their case to the European Union\u2019s highest court to see if MPs can vote to stop the UK leaving the bloc. Best for Britain, which\u00a0received\u00a0\u00a3800,000 from Hungarian-American progressive campaigner George Soros, is planning to target more than one million Britons in \u2018swing vote\u2019 constituencies,\u00a0reports\u00a0The Guardian.  Partnering with the far-left group HOPE not Hate \u2014 which has received\u00a0support\u00a0from Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations in the past \u2014 the anti-Brexit group\u00a0said it has \u2018street-level data\u2019 on some 90 constituencies which voted 45 to 50 percent in favour of staying in the UK and will launch its volunteer drive at Labour Party conference.  Over eight weeks,\u00a0volunteers for the \u2018We Want The Final Say\u2019 campaign will employ online targetting followed by delivering some half a million leaflets, aiming to convince voters to pressure their MPs to support a vote for the final Brexit deal.  Meanwhile, a cross-party group of politicians including Scottish Green MSPs and Labour and SNP MEPs have won an appeal at the Court of Session in Edinburgh to take their case to the EU Court of Justice to argue that Article 50 \u2014 the official mechanism for leaving the EU triggered in March 2017 \u2014 can be revoked without the permission of the other 27 member states.  \u00a0If the EU court agrees, it could embolden Remain MPs to attempt to overturn the June 2016 referendum result in the event of a no-deal, or clean, Brexit or if they deem the terms of the Government\u2019s agreed deal with the bloc unsatisfactory.  A spokesman\u00a0responded\u00a0that the Government is committed to implementing referendum result and \u201cwill not be revoking Article 50\u201d.  The announcements by both camps intent on defying the will of the people came after Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Chequers plan \u2014 regarded as a \u2018Brexit in Name Only\u2019 by Leavers \u2014 was rejected by the other 27 EU leaders and Eurocrats following a meeting in Salzburg, Austria, this week.  In response, the Prime Minister\u00a0made\u00a0a surprise statement, indicating that the UK will accelerate no-deal Brexit preparations, saying that it was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d for the bloc to reject the proposed terms without reason or counter negotiations. Appearing resolute, Mrs May said that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d.  \u00a0Responding to Mrs May\u2019s speech, former Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce and Co-Chairman of Leave Means Leave John Longworth\u00a0wrote\u00a0for BrexitCentral\u00a0that it \u201cremains to be seen whether this is merely a ruse to get her  through the Conservative conference to be followed by a remarkable \u2018triumph\u2019 by the Prime Minister, in turn returning with a truly bad deal from some future EU meeting, a betrayal of the Brexit vote dressed up as a fulfillment of the democratic will of the people\u201d.  On Saturday,\u00a0Leave Means Leave launches it's \u201cSave Brexit Campaign\u201d in Bolton, featuring UKIP MEP Nigel Farage, former Tory Brexit secretary David Davis, and Labour MP Kate Hoey, with a scheduled six rallies across the country and a fringe event at the forthcoming Conservative Party Conference.", "label": 0, "t": 0}

{"text": "THere is a very good reason why Social Security was setup the way it is so that even the richest rich get their Social Security.  The reason is valid today and also applies to healthcare. The designers of Social Security considered means testing for benefits but they quickly realized that if you do that, you immediately turn it into a welfare program.  The wealthier people who put a lot of money into it but get nothing out of it come to (naturally) resent it and resent those who are living off their money.  That program loses support over time and then gets ended or gutted in various ways.  By making sure EVERYONE puts into Social Security and EVERYONE gets out of Social Security, the \"welfare\" label doesn't apply and everyone can still support it.  I do not support means testing Social Security.  I support eliminating the income cap for paying into Social Security instead. The fee should be a flat percent of income, for ALL people, rich and poor.  Do that and its solvency is no longer an issue.    If you make universal healthcare a welfare system where the rich or wealthier people pay in but then also have to pay more just for their own personal healthcare, they WILL resent this and fight to end it.  I'm not sure what the answer is but isn't a simple fix.  Be careful about saying healthcare is a \"right\".  It sounds nice but what it actually means is that you are claiming that people are ENTITLED to someone else's labor. NO ONE is entitled to YOUR labor, or MY labor.", "label": 0, "t": 0}

{"text": "Ok so here is the bio for the veteran being interviewed in this video by this investigative reporter formerly with CNN! Before they went full blown traitor!  In 2011, 2LT Scott Bennett,\u00a0U.S. Army Special Operations Officer and Psychological Warfare analyst, worked in the highest levels of counterterrorism, intelligence, and politics in Washington DC. \u00a0 He had been awarded a Direct Military Commission by the President of the United States, and was a leading writer and thinker at the State Department Counterterrorism Office, U.S. Special Operations Command, U.S. Special Operations Command, and the George W. Bush Administration. \u00a0 After discovering and exposing massive corruption within the Obama White House and military contractors, he was unlawfully imprisoned on trumped up charges\u00a0by the Obama Administration. \u00a0Why? \u00a0In performance of his sworn military officer's oath, Bennett had filed intelligence analysis reports exposing illegal terrorist finance corruption and money-laundering operations involving the Clinton Foundation, the law firm Covington and Burling, the Department of Justice (Eric Holder, Lanny Breuer, Loretta Lynch, Kevin Downing), Saudi Arabia-Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood, US Central Command, and the international defense contractor,\u00a0Booz Allen Hamilton. \u00a0 \u00a0 Bennett was threatened, then imprisoned and tortured in a horrifying \"Kafkaesque\" sojourn; but with a renewed spiritual\u00a0strength, and an unyielding tenacity and determination, Bennett eventually\u00a0fought his way out and exposed the \"domestic enemies\" who had subverted the Constitution and betrayed the American people. \u00a0With a new multi-dimensional awareness of his Oath as a military officer of the United States Armed Forces, aided by \"military white hats\", and with the best legal minds in America, Bennett continued to file whistleblowing\u00a0reports to the military and\u00a0Congress, from\u00a0inside the federal prison\u00a0on a mountain top in Pennsylvania;\u00a0and terrorized the Obama Justice Department and Deep State. \u00a0It\u00a0was in the traumatic silence of jail and agony of isolation that 2LT Scott Bennett was able to synthesize his past work,\u00a0contacts, experience and intelligence research to discover the real\u00a0story behind Booz Allen Hamilton, the Carlyle Group,\u00a0and\u00a0the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and give the American people the truth they always suspected, but could never find. \u00a0Now they can. \u00a0 \u00a0 These reports were written on a typewriter and smuggled out of prison. \u00a0Using intelligence materials provided to him by Wikileaks, Edward Snowden (fellow Booz Allen Hamilton colleague who left the United States after seeing what happened to Scott Bennett), and Swiss Bank Whistleblower Brad Birkenfeld, 2LT Bennett successfully\u00a0reported one of the greatest examples of betrayal, incompetence, and government corruption against the American people,\u00a0and their\u00a0military men and women, in the history\u00a0of Western Civilization. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The compilation of\u00a0reports and letters to Congress, and synthesized intelligence materials (unclassified) is told in the book, \"SHELL GAME\"  Like a crucifix to a vampire, this is is the story every American can hold up to the face of politicians, challenge the lies and corruption that has been violating and bleeding them, and inspire a new generation of American leaders to arise. \u00a0 It starts with this story, and it starts\u00a0with you. \u00a0 --Scott Bennett, Ph.D. (U.S. Army, retired) \u00a0   (available at www.lulu.com)", "label": 0, "t": 1}

Time and again, the study conclusion was that the perception that men are always better drivers is pure fallacy. The conclusion was that men and women drive differently.   Having different driving skills only means that women are better at some aspects of driving while men excel at others (parking, for example, because of their spatial skills). On the other hand, men of all ages have higher accident and fatality rates because of their more aggressive, risk taking style of driving. Women tend to get into accidents from doing something stupid like distracted driving or forgetting to look for pedestrians. There are good and bad drivers of both sexes.

Anybody can hold and advocate unpopular opinions; but withdrawal from a Cabinet is a definite act, involving relations for good or ill with other people, and possibly affecting besides all else the whole machinery of domestic government. It concerns a man\u2019s principle and creed.\u2019\u2019  \u2018Principle\u2019? Do we still have that a hundred years later?  This \u2018Memorandum\u2019 was published by Morley\u2019s nephew in 1928 after Morley\u2019s death.  What \u2018consequences\u2019 did Morley see?  \u201cWhen we counted our gains, what would they amount to, when reckoned against the ferocious hatred that would burn with inextinguishable fire, for a whole generation at least, between two great communities better fitted to understand one another than any other pair in Europe?\u2019\u2019  \u2018Ferocious hatred\u2019 indeed! Who can doubt that hatred is the overwhelming attitude since? What other result?  \u201cThis moral devastation is a worse incident of war even than human carnage, and all the other curses with which war lashes its victims and its dupes. With a fleet of overwhelming power, a disinterestedness beyond suspicion, a Foreign Minister of proved ability, truthfulness and self-control, when the smoke of battle-fields had cleared from the European sky, England might have exerted an influence not to be acquired by a hundred of her little Expeditionary Forces.\u2019\u2019  This \u2018moral devastation\u2019 poisoned human life like nothing ever before! Modernity has not found the antidote yet!  Morley nailed it!", "label": 0, "t": 0}
